<p>On most *nix systems, the file <code>/usr/share/dict/words</code> contains a bunch of words. On my machine, it contains 235886 words.</p>
<p>I computed the length of each word, i.e.Â the number of characters, and tabulated how many words consist of 1 character, 2 characters, etc.</p>
<p>The most frequent word length is 9.</p>
<p>Here is a histogram of word lengths.</p>
