## Welcome to your Assignment 3B!

You may modify this README accordingly to the instructions from assignment 3B, *including* modifying the title of the README to be the name of your app instead of the current "Welcome to your Assignment 3B!".

A reminder of what your README must include:

+  Your choice of assignment clearly stated: Option A - BC Liquor app, or Option B - your own Shiny app.
+  A description of your app. In the case of Option A, write about what makes your app different from the "basic" version after implementing your chosen features.
+ A link to the URL where the app is hosted.
+ Whatever dataset you will use, acknowledge its source clearly. Remember that we value open, reproducible science: this means that the user of your app should have direct access to the data, or know where to go to access it.

When you edit this README - if you decide to do **Option A** for your assignment - make sure to include the following acknowledgement:

+ The BC Liquor app was created by [Dean Attali](deanattali.com), and was copied into the folder "BCL-Shiny" in this repo from Dean's [bcl folder](https://github.com/daattali/shiny-server/tree/master/bcl) in his [shiny-server](https://github.com/daattali/shiny-server) repo.

*Remember to also update your main README to include a link to a running instance of your Shiny app.*
