## Assignment 5B

For this assignment, I had the choice of 3 options to complete:

+ **Option A:** Strings Regex
+ **Option B:** R Package 
+ **Option C:** Shiny App

Full details of each option can be found in the `assignment-5B.md` file.

I went with the first option - completing exercises on regular expressions. My solutions for the exercises can be found in the `assignment-5B-answers.md` file.
