# Assigment 1

This is the first assigment for my STAT 545-B class.

The assigment was split into two main parts:

* The first part focused on creating a function in R and performing test on said function
* The second part focused on fitting a model and displaying results / evaluating the model

The completed assigment can be viewed in the "assignment-1B.md" file.
